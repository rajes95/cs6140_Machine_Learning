Assignment 1

My project was developed on Ubuntu 18.04 in Python 3.6.

In order to run the code for this assignment, the following dependencies are necessary:

numpy   1.18.4 :- pip install numpy            OR  pip3 install numpy
pandas  0.25.3 :- pip install pandas           OR  pip3 install pandas
sklearn 0.21.3 :- pip install -U scikit-learn  OR  pip3 install -U scikit-learn

In order to run code, please open the terminal and switch directories to the /src folder.

To run problem 1.1a:
    - Run the command 'python3 irisDecisionTree.py'
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 1.1b:
    - Run the command 'python3 spambaseDecisionTree.py'
    - Currently this only uses 120 rows of data because more data will take a lot of time 
       to make sure the code is working. In order to change this and use a different 
       amount of data, you can modify *line 107* to include more data or comment it out.
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 2.1a:
    - Run the command 'python3 mushroomMultiwayDecisionTree.py'
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 2.1b:
    - Run the command 'python3 mushroomBinaryDecisionTree.py'
    - Currently this only uses 150 rows of data because more data will take a lot of time 
       just to make sure the code is working. In order to change this and use a different 
       amount of data, you can modify *line 103* to include more data or comment it out.
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 6a:
    -Run the command 'python3 housingBinaryRegressionTree.py'
    - Currently this only uses 150 rows of data because more data will take a lot of time 
       just to make sure the code is working. In order to change this and use a different 
       amount of data, you can modify *line 420* to include more data or comment it out.
    - Results will be printed to the console.
