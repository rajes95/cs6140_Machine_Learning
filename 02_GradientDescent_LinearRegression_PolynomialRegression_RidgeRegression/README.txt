Assignment 2

My project was developed on Ubuntu 18.04 in Python 3.6.

In order to run the code for this assignment, the following dependencies are necessary:

numpy      1.18.4 :- pip install numpy                   OR  pip3 install numpy
pandas     0.25.3 :- pip install pandas                  OR  pip3 install pandas
matplotlib 2.2.2  :- python -m pip install -U matplotlib OR  python3 -m pip3 install -U matplotlib

In order to run code, please open the terminal and switch directories to the /src folder.

To run problem 2 & 3: Housing Data:
    - Run the command 'python3 housingDataLinearRegressionGradientDescent.py'
    - Normal Equations vs Gradient Descent can be seen in Fold 1 Output
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 2 & 3: Yacht Data:
    - Run the command 'python3 yachtDataLinearRegressionGradientDescent.py'
    - Normal Equations vs Gradient Descent can be seen in Fold 1 Output
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 2: Concrete Data:
    - Run the command 'python3 concreteDataLinearRegressionGradientDescent.py'
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 5.1: Sinusoid Data:
    - Run the command 'python3 sinusoidDataPolynomialRegression.py'
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 5.1: Yacht Data:
    - Run the command 'python3 yachtDataPolynomialRegression.py'
    - Results will be printed to the console.

To run problem 7: Sinusoid Data:
    - Run the command 'python3 sinusoidRidgeRegression.py'
    - Results will be printed to the console.
