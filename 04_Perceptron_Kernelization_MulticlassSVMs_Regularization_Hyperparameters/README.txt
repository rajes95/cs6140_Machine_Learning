Assignment 4

My project was developed on Ubuntu 18.04 in Python 3.6.

In order to run the code for this assignment, the following dependencies are necessary:

numpy      1.18.4 :- pip install numpy                   OR  pip3 install numpy
pandas     0.25.3 :- pip install pandas                  OR  pip3 install pandas
matplotlib 2.2.2  :- python -m pip install -U matplotlib OR  python3 -m pip3 install -U matplotlib
sklearn    0.23.1 :- pip install -U scikit-learn         OR  pip3 install -U scikit-learn

In order to run code, please open the terminal and switch directories to the ./src folder.
